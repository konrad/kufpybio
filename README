== About ==

This is a collection of Python classes and functions frequently used
by me in bioinformatical data processing. It is currently in an early
and unstable state so use it carefully. In most cases only selected
features (the ones I needed for my purposes) are accessible.

== Python version ==

The code is developed using Python 3.3 or higher but might also run
with Python 2.7.
